        It is believed that tattooing in most ancient cultures was done by professionals and medical experts, as shamans or holy men, during different rituals. How they did it is not completely clear but there are findings of needles and awls made from copper and bones included in a kit which also contained palette, pigments, resins, tattoo combs in different sizes, incense and amulets from various eras. The palette was used for pulverizing cosmetic minerals with rocks. Archaeologists have found tattoo tools and pigment older than any mummy found dated from 38,000 BC. to 10,000 BC.
        
        In more resent times we have proof that shows how in for example New Zeeland and Hawaii where they used similar techniques, they used soot for ink and with a comb and “hammer” or hand hitting the ink into the body. These techniques were passed from parent to child and are still practiced today.
        
        The traditional methods of tattooing started to rapidly disappear because of Thomas Edison. In 1875 he invented an electric pen, the copying machine Xerox. This invention was later reinvented as the first tattoo machine by the New Yorker Samuel F. O'Reilly in 1891. And that was the predecessor to the tool we use today, still there are a few who who continue practise the old ways.
