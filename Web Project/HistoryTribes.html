        Maori New Zeeland
        
        Early 18th century there was a fashion of trading Maori heads just for the reason of their unique tattoos. When the head of a tribe died the members would removed and preserve the head. The western civilization were intrigued by this fact and a trading for heads occurred. The Maori people got guns and the travellers got heads for showing when they returned home. The need of heads escalated and the Maoris started selling the heads of enemies and eventually started to kill each other.
        
        The practice of tattooing in New Zeeland is called tā moko, it is believed to come from the Māori god of earthquake. And here is a short story about how it came to be:
        
        Mataoro, a normal man, fell in love with Niwakera, the daughter of the underworld’s ruler, and they married. After one time beating her she unfortunately died. Mataoro then followed her to the underworld to seek forgiveness. While being there the ruler of the underworld (Niwakeras father) taught him the art of tā moko (tattooing) and before he let him return to the world of living, covered him with tattoos as a reminder of not committing anymore evil acts.  
        
        Although Matoro got his tattoos for remembering to be a good human being, that is not only the case of Maori tattoos. It’s to feel connection to ancestors, cultural expression and pride, each moko tattoo is individual and unique. It shows social status, occupation, and personal/family history.
        
        Mens tattoos are usually on the face, bum and thighs while the women tattoos are on their lips and chin. The ritual of getting a tattoo used to took place in temporary outdoor shelters. By Mixing oil and sooth from burned resin of the kauri trees and hammered into the skin by traditional tools they created their tattoos. To prevent infections it was recommended to refrain from washing and sex, and people tattooing their mouth they should be drinking/eating through a straw or funnel. 
        
        During the 20th century the needle and modern tattoo tools were introduced but still there are people practicing the traditional methods.
