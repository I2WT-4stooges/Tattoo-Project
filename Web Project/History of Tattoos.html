                <h1>Tattoo History</h1>

                <p>There has always been a need for decorating our bodies if not to attract a partner, to show status or where to belong. From jewellery and clothes to piercings and body art in form of painting, scarification, and tattoos. 
                    From multiple archaeological sites across the world scientists have found samples of tattooed skin from mummies. The methods used during those ancient times are similar to todays though tools have changed drastically since then, the principle of achieving the tattoo remains the same. By introducing foreign substances in form of minerals or pigments into our skin, create a text, picture, or symbol on the body.
