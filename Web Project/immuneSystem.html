            <h1>Priming the immune system</h1>    

            <p class="date">Date 27/11/2020</p>            

            <p> 
                More recently, research also has uncovered some good news. Most people don’t experience any problems from a tattoo. And in them, getting inked body art may confer health benefits. The inking process may actually turn on the immune system, helping to keep such individuals healthy.
                That’s the finding of a study by Christopher Lynn and his team at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Lynn is an anthropologist, someone who studies the social habits of people. He was interested in the idea that tattoos might signal someone’s good health to others.It’s true that most people heal smoothly. Still, getting a tattoo is stressful, he notes. And it can be dangerous: People can get infections from unclean equipment. They can suffer allergic reactions. And in cultures that use traditional tools to create large tattoos, the pain and stress has occasionally even led to death. “Historically and cross-culturally,” Lynn says, “peoples have referred to tattooing as toughening the body up or ‘hardening’ it.”

            <p>
                The researchers recruited 29 people who were planning to get a tattoo. Before the inking started, each person put a swab under his or her tongue for up to two minutes. The saliva-soaked swab then went into a collection tube. It would be analyzed later. Each person repeated that saliva collection after getting the tattoo.Lynn’s group then analyzed the saliva samples for cortisol. It’s a hormone. The body makes more of it when someone becomes stressed. No surprise: Everyone had an increase in cortisol after a tattoo. Getting this body art is, after all, stressful. But cortisol went up less in people “with lots of tat experience,” Lynn found.The researchers also looked for levels of an immune protein called IgA. It’s short for immunoglobulin A (Ih-MU-no-glob-yu-lin A). IgA is an important defender against germs, Lynn notes, such as the virus that causes the common cold. The IgA protein is found in the digestive tract and the body’s upper airways. Its job is to glom onto germs and other materials the body wants to get rid of. IgA’s presence flags such invaders so that the body’s immune cells know to track them down.When people are stressed, cortisol lowers their immunity, Lynn explains. He suspected the stress of getting a tattoo might show up in IgA levels. And that’s precisely what he and his team found: IgA levels fell after getting a tattoo. This was especially true in people who were getting their first tattoo.People who already had tattoos experienced less of a drop in their IgA levels. Levels of the protein also returned to normal faster. Those with many tattoos showed the smallest change.“The body actually adjusts to getting tattoos for people who have a lot [of them],” Lynn explains. In these people, IgA dips only slightly during the process of tattooing. That means their bodies can start to heal more quickly, he explains. His team call this quick recovery a “priming” of the immune system. In other words, Lynn explains, a tattoo gets the immune system ready to face other challenges.

                Does that priming carry over to other areas of health — such as helping people fight infections? Lynn doesn’t yet know. “I think it would go beyond the tattoo experience,” he says. The stress response is very general, he notes. “So it basically [tells] the system to be vigilant.”
                Some heavily tattooed people claim to be resistant to colds and to heal quickly from minor injuries. Such reports are anecdotal, or individual stories not yet shown to be typical or reliable. But such claims have prompted Lynn to start a new scientific study. It will seek to check out whether such benefits extend beyond the tattoo shop.
