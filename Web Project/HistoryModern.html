        Modern History 
        
        From socially unacceptable, associated with criminals and sailors,  having to hide the tattoos to acceptance and a show of self.  
       
        10th century to -18th century
        
        During the 10th century it was common to see northern tribes with tattoos covering their arms all the way up to the neck. The tattoos on Englishmen were occasionally used to identify fallen warriors but mostly for protection, the most common tattoo was the Jerusalem cross.
        
        16th century was when Japanese practise of tattooing was birthed, before then only fishermen, prostitutes and manual workers to show status. But not until mid-18th century where the tattoos really speed up even though they were still forbidden. One reason was the jealousy of the kimono. Only royals were allowed to bear them, and the lower classes found a different way of decorating their bodies in form of tattoos. Since being forbidden the artists were practicing in secret.
        
        17th century Samoan islands Dutch sailors wrote that they met people with incredible fabric strapped to their bodies, in fact this was tattoos. The way of acquiring tattoos in the Samoa islands have changed very little over 2000 years and resembles many other traditional tattoo methods. By using combs in different sizes and hammering the pigment or ink, it is very painful and takes an immense amount of time to finish. The word tattoo might have originated from the Samoan word ‘Tatau’.
        
        18th century, people in high positions started to get tattoos. Mid-century the tattoos were more visible on both artists and some US presidents, that were showing their art publicly. Tattoo shops now started to open up all over US and UK. 1870 it became immensely popular amongst the upper class and even spread up to the royal elite. Still the middle class associated tattoos to criminals and sailors and was not very fond of the idea of getting a tattoo.
        
        19th century common people saw the military and sailors covered with tattoos who became more and more popular. In 1929 the Duke of Montrose and Sir Ian Colquhoun revealed their tattoos on a formal dinner this was the first time a tattoo had been mentioned in an English newspaper.

        1900-1940
        
        Tattoos where not yet common amongst the population, most that possessed a tattoo was sailors and circus artists. To show their story or profession, tattooing was used as an inition rite for the young sailor and the older they got the more tattoos the had, there were specific ones showing accomplishments, that you had sailed across the equator or more than 5000 miles, while others like compasses and birds, boats were common aswell.
        
        The very first female tattoo artist in England emerged during this timewas Jessie Knight she was active around 1920-1960, In the 20s cosmetic tattoos became popular, this was not publicly acceptable and was kept hidden. Later in history it would disappear and now reappear in modern times. Today it’s not uncomman that girls tattoo their lips, eyelids or eyebrows just as in the 20s.
        
        another important woman to mention is Shanghai-Kate she is also called The American godmother of tattoos and has practiced tattooing for over 50 years and is still active in America today. Shanghai-Kate says that she believes getting a tattoo is in our DNA and that it is a very sensual experience where you are very intimate and trusting in the artist.

        During this period in time the tattoo was seen as a symbol of manliness.

        There was a huge movement against tattoos that claimed tattoos gave people Hepatitis. There were no evidence proving this claim but still tattoo parlours all over went out of business. Skulls and skulls with crossbones became popular especially amongst bikers, and skulls are still one of the most popular tattoos today.

It was also big for tattoos, well the tattoos were bigger, and finally accepted. Tattoo artists started to thrive, experimenting with more colours in their designs. The Celtic knots and roses were amongst favourite designs back then. In 1988 Arnold Rubin published a collection of works called the “Marks of civilaziation”

        2000
        
        The year that society was supposed to end came and we survived! Although something horrible did happen, the “tramp stamp” luckily the trend only lasted for a few years and the other popular tattoos like yin yang and butterflies are still popular till today. Celebrities continued to set trends so too with tattoos. Tattoo shows like L.A. ink now started to send on TV.

        Now were already in the 2020 and so far it has been total disaster for many businesses including tattooing.
        Still research is being made on temporary tattoos that will be able to read your vital functions or tell you to get in the shade when you have had too much sun. The tattoo is approaching a revolution and I for one is extremely excited to see where this will lead!
