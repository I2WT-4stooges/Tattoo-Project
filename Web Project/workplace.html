            <h1>Tattoos in the Workplace</h1>

                The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not individuals with tattoos were looked down upon in their chosen profession simply based on tattoo presence. Specifically, it was hypothesized that there is a stigma attached to individuals with tattoos in the workplace in comparison to non-tattooed employees. Previous research has looked at the attitudes toward tattooed individuals based on style, gender, and size, yet little research has been done to understand the attitudes toward people with tattoos in the workplace. This study sought to determine if stigmas are placed on individuals with tattoos. To do so, the appropriateness of tattoos in various white and blue collar professions was measured. In addition, the size and visibility of the tattoos were factors in determining attitudes. Although tattoos are becoming more socially acceptable, different traits are still being associated with tattoos. Various personality and physical characteristics of individuals with tattoos were addressed to understand if character is being judged based on body ink. Overall, the results of this study found no differences in attitudes toward individuals with tattoos in the workplace compared to non-tattooed employees. However, the perceived personal traits of tattooed and non- tattooed individuals varied.

                As the art of tattooing has become more popular and accepted within various societies, stigmas and stereotypes of those with such body modifications remain. For over three hundred years, tattoos have been viewed as a deviant act, one that causes individuals to associate those with tattoos with risky and foolish behavior. Despite the characteristics of tattoos being large or small, tribal or fashionable, people did not express any difference in opinion toward individuals who endured the pain of tattooing. The stigmas and attitudes placed upon these individuals continue in an array of areas, as those with tattoos are judged based on personality, character flaws, behavioral patterns, intelligence, and approachability. Such judgments of the tattooed population may have an effect on whether a person chooses to get a tattoo. The decision to be tattooed can influence social status and in turn diminish role expectations by permanently altering the body. Multiple studies have attempted to assess such stigmas in an effort to understand why body ink has such a dramatic effect on the way a person is perceived and identified.

            <p class="articles">The research literature on tattoos and stigmas is limited, but several studies have attempted to understand the attitudes toward tattoos, as well as their origin (Burgess & Clark, 2010). Burgess and Clark investigated the origins of tattoos in addition to how the various designs had an effect on the attitudes of others. As tattoos were introduced in the l700's, specific notions about those who received them were subsequently placed into the developing subculture. Thus, the tattooed were viewed as straying from everyday social norms and assimilating into a deviant and aggressive social group. Burgess and Clark designed two experiments, one in which participants were to group different tattoo designs. The participants proceeded to explain the appearance of the individuals who had those tattoos, as well as to describe the meanings o f the tattoos. A portion o f the tattoos depicted were of "cute" nature, such as dolphins and bright colored work, whereas others were dark in color and featured tribal designs. Following this study, the tattoo groupings from study one were then rated by a group of students on a scale of friendly to aggressive. Results showed that participants viewed the "cute" design tattoos as more friendly and the tribal tattoos aggressively (Burgess & Clark, 2010).
